## Project Overview
Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company, supplied data on customer bike rides for this project. The main objective is to analyze the data, uncover customer behavior patterns, and deliver practical recommendations to enhance Cyclistic’s bike-sharing service.

## Phase 1: Data Cleaning and Preparation

During this phase, the data was cleaned and prepped for analysis. The key steps involved:
- Calculating ride durations using start and end times.
- Removing rides that were too short or excessively long.
- Verifying data accuracy and consistency.
  
 ## Phase 2: Data Analysis

In this phase, the data was analyzed to gain deeper insights into customer behavior. The analysis included:

- Calculating summary statistics for ride duration.
- Categorizing riders into annual members and casual users.
- Examining total rides and ride durations for each customer type.
- Identifying ride length trends across different days of the week and months.
- Comparing ride behaviors between annual members and casual riders.

## Phase 3: Data Visualization

To effectively present key insights, visualizations were created, including:

- Total rides per day of the week for each customer type.
- Usage patterns based on time of day.
- Monthly trends in bike usage.
- Average ride lengths across weekdays and months.
- Customer preferences for different bike types.

## Phase 4: Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

- Increase marketing efforts targeting casual riders during the winter-spring season
- Develop strategies to encourage more frequent weekend riding for members and midweek for casual riders
- Evaluate the popularity of docked bikes and explore potential improvements.
- Prioritize upgrades and maintenance for the classic bike fleet.
- Introduce longer-term rental options to attract casual riders.
- Increase advertising and marketing efforts for e-bikes

## Conclusion
This data analysis project offers important insights into customer behavior and preferences for Cyclistic’s bike-sharing service. The recommendations are designed to optimize operations and improve the overall customer experience.
